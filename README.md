# Task Organizer


## Objective

To use Django and Python to build a simple to-do list web application.
  
## Problem Statement
Build a simple web application with Django to implement a to-do list where you can add
and delete tasks, and mark them done.
## Functions 
* We can add new categories to the application from the Django admin panel, for which we create a superuser in the process of creating the application.
* To create a new task, we need to feed in the title, pick one from the list of categories, and select a due date to finish the task by. Then, we click the New Task button in green and the task appears in the list of tasks under the two buttons. This includes the task description, category, created and due dates, the task category, and a checkbox. New tasks get added to the bottom of the list of tasks
* When we have finished a task, we can tick the checkbox. And by clicking the Delete Tasks button in red, we can delete the selected tasks from our application.
